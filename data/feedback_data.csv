2,1080,34,Love this dress!,"It's sooo pretty. I happened to find it in a store, and I'm glad I did because I never would have ordered it online due to its petite size. I'm 5'8"" and the length is just right for me. Would definitely be a true midi on someone petite.",5,1,4,General,Dresses,Dresses
3,1077,60,Some major design flaws,"I had high hopes for this dress but found it outrageously small. I initially ordered petite small but couldn't zip it up. The petite medium was just okay. The top half fit nicely but the bottom was tight and had some cheap layers.",3,0,0,General,Dresses,Dresses

6,1080,49,Not for the very petite,"I love Tracy Reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. I'm just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0P in this brand. The dress is pretty but overwhelming for my small frame. It needed alterations.",2,0,4,General,Dresses,Dresses

8,858,39,Shimmer, surprisingly goes with lots,"Ordered this in carbon for store pick up and used it to pair with various skirts and pants. Everything went with it. Color is a nice charcoal with shimmer. It's a bit big and loose but I kept it.",4,1,4,General Petite,Tops,Knits
9,1077,24,Flattering,"I love this dress. I usually get an XS but it runs a bit snug in the bust so I ordered up a size. Very flattering and feminine.",5,1,0,General,Dresses,Dresses
10,1077,34,Such a fun dress!,"I'm 5'5"" and 125 lbs. I ordered the S petite to ensure the length wasn't too long. Fits snug but not tight. Love that it can be dressed up or down.",5,1,0,General,Dresses,Dresses
11,1077,53,Dress looks like it's made of cheap material,"Dress runs small especially around the zipper. Ordered SP which was tight. The material felt cheap and may rip easily. Disappointed as it was meant for Christmas.",3,0,14,General,Dresses,Dresses

14,767,44,Runs big,"Bought the black XS to go under the Larkspur midi dress. The XS fit well around the chest but was flowy around the lower half. It could easily be nightwear too.",5,1,0,Initmates,Intimate,Intimates
15,1077,50,Pretty party dress with some issues,"Nice for holiday gatherings. Fits well, but the quality of fabrics is poor. The delicate netting on the top layer got stuck in the zipper.",3,1,1,General,Dresses,Dresses
16,1065,47,Nice, but not for my body,"These pants didn't fit my body shape. They're for an hour-glass figure and too tight in the waist for me. They're well-made but didn't suit me.",4,1,3,General,Bottoms,Pants
